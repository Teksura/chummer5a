Chummer uses a common Requirements system for almost all objects stored in the data XMLs. This system uses a combination of [**forbidden**](#forbidden) and [**required**](#required) XML elements that compare properties of the current character or parent object against a desired state (for example, is the current character a Troll, or do they have the Adept quality). Values are returned as a boolean, with Required nodes expecting a true result and Forbidden expecting false to either allow or prohibit the object from being added. 

When designing custom data files it is critical to note that items that are exclusive of each other MUST have a required/forbidden node referencing each other. If this is not done and one object forbids another, if that object is later added no error will be generated. For example, the Astral Beacon and Astral Chameleon qualities each have a forbidden node that references each other; if one of these were not present it would be possible to purchase the quality with the forbidden entry, then the quality that does not.
