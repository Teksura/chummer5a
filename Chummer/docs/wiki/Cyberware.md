## <a id="grade"></a>Grade Node

**id** (required): the internal name of the Grade. All ID fields are standard GUIDs, which can be generated by [external websites](https://www.guidgenerator.com) or plugins.

**name** (required): the name of the Grade.

**ess** (required): the Essence multiplier for the Grade.

**cost** (required): the Cost multiplier for the Grade.

**avail** (required): the Availability adjustment for the Grade. Negative numbers bring the item's Grade closer to 0.

**source** (required): the code for the Sourcebook that this entry comes from. See [books.xml](Books "books.xml").

**page** (required): the page number this item can be found on in the Sourcebook.

## <a id="categories"></a>Categories Node

**category** (required): the name of the Cyberware Category. This list populates the Category list found in the Select Cyberware window. Categories are used to group Cyberware into groups such as _Headware_, _Eyeware_, and _Cyberlimb_.

## <a id="cyberware"></a>Cyberware Node

**id** (required): the internal name of the Cyberware. All ID fields are standard GUIDs, which can be generated by [external websites](https://www.guidgenerator.com) or plugins.

**name** (required): the name of the Cyberware.

**category** (required): the Category that this piece of Cyberware belongs to. This must match one of the Categories defined in the [**Categories** Node](#categories "Categories Node").

**limbslot** (optional): if this is a Cyberlimb, what type of "limb slot" does it use on the character. Acceptable values: _arm_, _head_, _leg_, _torso_.

**rating** (optional): when present, Ratings for this piece of Cyberware are enabled. The maximum Rating is equal to the value specified here.

**minrating** (optional): the minimum Rating for this piece of Cyberware. If used, `<rating>` must also be specified.

**ess** (required): the Essence cost for this piece of Cyberware. May contain the `Rating` keyword if Ratings are enabled. May contain mathematical formula such as `Rating * 0.1`. May used `FixedValues` if necessary. See [Using Fixed Values](#fixedvalues "Using Fixed Values") for more information.

**capacity** (required): the Capacity used by this piece of Cyberware. Pieces that may be used as plugins (that is, those that can be placed inside of a larger part like a cyberlimb) must be enclosed in square brackets, identical to the style found in the Shadowrun 4 book. For example, [3]. May used `FixedValues` if necessary. See [Using Fixed Values](#fixedvalues "Using Fixed Values") for more information.

**required** (optional): the Cyberware has certain requirements that the character must meet before it can be selected. See [**Required** Node](#required "Required Node") for more information.

**avail** (required): the Availability for this piece of Cyberware. May contain the `Rating` keyword if Ratings are enabled. May contain mathematical formula such as `(Rating * 3)F`. avail can start with _+_ to indicate that it increases the base Cyberware's Availability instead. avail starting with _+_ can also include R or F to change its Availability. For example `+3R` would add 3 to the parent item's Availability and make it Restricted if it was not already. This will not downgrade an item from Forbidden to Restricted - this highest restriction is always kept. May used `FixedValues` if necessary. See [Using Fixed Values](#fixedvalues "Using Fixed Values") for more information.

**addweapon** (optional): when this piece of Cyberware is added, Chummer looks for a Weapon in [weapons.xml](Weapons "weapons.xml") and adds it to the character. The value must match the name of a Weapon exactly. This is used to add Cyberweapons to a character.

**cost** (required): the Cost for this piece of Cyberware. May contain the `Rating` keyword if Ratings are enabled. May contain mathematical formula such as `Rating * 3000`. May contain a variable value such as `Variable(20-100)` or `Variable(10000+)` to give the item a variable cost if it does not use Ratings. May used `FixedValues` if necessary. See [Using Fixed Values](#fixedvalues "Using Fixed Values") for more information.

**allowgear** (optional): This is used to allow Gear to be attached to a piece of Cyberware. See [**Allowgear** Node](#allowgear "Allowgear Node") for more information. 

**bonus** (optional): a bonus node that describes any bonuses this entry grants. Values may contain the `Rating` keyword if Ratings are enabled. See [Improvement Manager](Improvement-Manager) for more information.

**forcegrade** (optional): forces the Cyberware to be added using the Grade specified. This must match one of the Grades specified in the [**Grades** Node](#grade "Grades Node").

**subsystems** (optional): By default, Cyberware may only have plugins from their own Category. This is used to specify additional Categories of Cyberware that can be added to this piece of Cyberware. See [**Subsystems** Node](#subsystems "Subsystems Node") for more information.

**source** (required): the code for the Sourcebook that this entry comes from. See [books.xml](Books "books.xml").

**page** (required): the page number this item can be found on in the Sourcebook.

## <a id="fixedvalues"></a>Using FixedValues

When an element does not follow a particular formula, values may be assigned to each Rating using `FixedValues`. `FixedValues` negates the need to create multiple copies of something like Cybereyes because one or two elements stray from the formula the other versions of it use, or that follow no formula at all. `FixedValues` uses a comma-separated list of values to specify the element's value at each Rating of the Cyberware. One item must exist per Rating of the Cyberware. For example, Cybereyes' Cost is 500, 750, 1000, and 1500 respectively. Since the last Rating of Cybereyes strays from the formula, `FixedValues` can be used. The Cost would then be written as `<cost>FixedValues(500,750,1000,1500)</cost>`
