# Installation Guide

Complete installation instructions for Chummer5a on all supported platforms.

## Windows Installation

1. **Download the latest release** from our [releases page](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a/releases)
2. **Extract the files** to a folder of your choice
3. **Run Chummer5.exe** - The application should start immediately

### Prerequisites
- **.NET Framework 4.8** - Download from [Microsoft's website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-net-framework-4-8-offline-installer-for-windows-9d23f658-3b97-68ab-d013-aa3c3e7495e0) if not already installed
- **Windows 7 or later** - The application requires a modern Windows version

### Security Warnings
Windows SmartScreen and antivirus software may warn you that running the program is unsafe. This is because:
- The auto-updater downloads files from the internet
- The auto-updater can replace and delete files
- The auto-updater can run downloaded executables

**The program is completely safe** - we have taken extra precautions to prevent unintentional file deletion. You can audit the auto-updater code [here](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a/blob/7bcde977da74f4ec1bb0721210cf2f7bba80cff1/Chummer/Forms/Utility%20Forms/ChummerUpdater.cs).

## Mono Support (Not Recommended)

**Note:** Mono support in Chummer5a has been mostly abandoned. Do not expect Chummer5a to function properly under Mono.

If you still want to try:
1. Install Mono from [mono-project.com](http://www.mono-project.com/download/)
2. Run: `mono Chummer5.exe`
3. Not all elements are supported on non-Windows platforms
4. Translator doesn't seem to currently run

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **".NET Framework not installed"**
   - Download and install .NET Framework 4.8 from Microsoft

2. **"Application won't start"**
   - Check that you have the latest version
   - Try running as administrator
   - Check Windows compatibility mode

3. **"Antivirus blocking the application"**
   - Add Chummer5a folder to antivirus exclusions
   - The application is safe despite the warnings

4. **"Character sheet preview not working"**
   - Ensure Internet Explorer is installed and updated
   - On Linux/macOS, install IE8 via winetricks
